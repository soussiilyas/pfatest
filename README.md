## Latest Updates:

10/13/20 Daily data (under the /dailies/ folder) has been added for 10/12 and 10/11, note that some tweets will bleed into the following day due to different timezones captured.

10/11/20 Version 31 of the dataset, we have added the regular weekly update and some additional historical tweets in Russian, courtesy of our collaborators. Dailies have been added for 10/10, 10/9, and 10/8.

10/8/20 Daily data (under the /dailies/ folder) has been added for 10/7 and 10/6, note that some tweets will bleed into the following day due to different timezones captured.

10/6/20 Daily data (under the /dailies/ folder) has been added for 10/5 and 10/4, note that some tweets will bleed into the following day due to different timezones captured.

10/5/20 Version 30 of the dataset, we have added the regular weekly update and some additional historical tweets in Russian, courtesy of our collaborators. Dailies have been added for 10/3, 10/2, and 10/1.

# Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset for scientific use

Due to the relevance of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we are releasing our dataset of tweets acquired from the Twitter Stream related to COVID-19 chatter. The first 9 weeks of data (from January 1st, 2020 to March 11th, 2020) contain very low tweet counts as we filtered other data we were collecting for other research purposes, however, one can see the dramatic increase as the awareness for the virus spread. Dedicated data gathering started from March 11th yielding over 4 million tweets a day.

The data collected from the stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence are:  English, Spanish, and French. We release all tweets and retweets on the full dataset, and a cleaned version with no retweets. There are several practical reasons for us to leave the retweets, tracing important tweets and their dissemination is one of them. For NLP tasks we provide the top 1000 frequent terms, the top 1000 bigrams, and the top 1000 trigrams. Some general statistics per day are included for both datasets.

We will continue to update the dataset every two days here and weekly in Zenodo.

# Usage 

All tweets ids found in full_dataset.tsv and full_dataset-clean.tsv need to be hydrated using a tool like get_metada.py from the Social Media Toolkit (SMMT) released by our lab or Twarc. 

Note: All the code in the /processing_code folder is provided as-is, it was used to generate the provided files from the source Tweet JSON files. Documentation will be gradually added for these scripts.
